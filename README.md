# Buer's autoexec.cfg and more! :)

These will change game features by disabling certain aspects of the game. Most of these have comments to help people understand what does what, and this is 100% safe to use.
Just be sure to change settings that are obviously tweaked based on my computer vs. yours. Example: **ctrl F** and search for "Nvidia".

I am currently working on trying to fix some sound issues!!! Please, **DO NOT USE** the commands for that unless you are having sound issues as well.


With the network commands, these .cfg's will compress packets and send them out faster.

My binds allow for bhopping through mouse wheel up/down(easier), Showing player POS(Position)/Velocity, fps, as well as a quick sound changer via "0".
Side note: many of these binds work ONLY in game. Don't panic when you're testing them at the menu!

Theres also an extra command to Quick DC to login screen via F10 as I like to rage quit because hackers are stupid shit heads.
F1 will Ping Mozam, even when there is no Mozam. Don't be annoying or I'll delete your System32.
